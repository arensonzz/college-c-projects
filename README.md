# College C Projects
These are collection of C language projects i did during my CS undergrad years. Each folder contains different project.

## How to check projects locally?
* Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arensonzz/college-c-projects.git
    ```
* Compile a project using CMake
    ```sh
    cd simple-tetris
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    ./simple_tetris
    ```
* You can also compile projects using any C compiler that supports at least C89.
