# College C Projects
These are collection of C language projects i did during my CS undergrad years. Each folder contains different project.

## How to check projects locally?
* Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arensonzz/college-c-projects.git
    ```
* Compile any project using a C compiler that supports at least C89.
