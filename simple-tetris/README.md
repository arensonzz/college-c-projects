## Project Description
Design a program, which a user could play the "TETRIS" game.

## Project Details
* Your program should ask the size of the game board.
* Your program should create different pieces randomly at each round.
* Available pieces are:

<img src="images/classic_tetris_tetrominos.jpg"
     alt="Classic tetris tetrominos"
     style="margin: 10px 30px; max-width: 600px" />
* Your program should rotate the given piece if the user demands.
* The user would give the x coordinates for placing the leftmost corner of the
given puzzle piece.
* The program would place the given puzzle piece to the available most bottom part
of the game board.
* If any horizontal line is full with puzzle pieces, your program should break the line
and let all the pieces placed in the upper line fall down until a piece occurs.
* Your program should also calculate the points obtained from the aforementioned
lines.
* Your program also should save the highest score.
* The program should end if the upperline of the game board consists of any puzzle
pieces.
* The user could terminate the game, whenever he/she wants.
